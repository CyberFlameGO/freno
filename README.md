# freno

A throttler service. At this time it serves the question "may I write to the MySQL cluster?" by investigating replication lag on the cluster.

### What's in a name?

"Freno" is Spanish for "brake", as in _car brake_. Basically "throttler" was the ideal name for this service, but it is being used in some many other repositories that we went looking for something else. When we looked up the word "Freno", we found the following sentence use sample:

> Echa el freno, magdaleno!

This reminded us of the 80's and that was it.
